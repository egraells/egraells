## Hey! I'm Esteve!
🧑‍🦳 I'm a Developer/Architect/Dad/Spouse in Barcelona. 

💖 I love creating new things by coding and and sharing with others.

🖥️ I have experience on Salesforce Development as a developer and architect, software engineer (Java, Python) and I am fascinated by AI/DL/ML tech for the things we can create with.

📖 I wrote a book about Salesforce development, 2 other booksites (books in a web form) and I keep blogging here [Personal Blog](https://forcegraells.com).

🍹 I've given some talks in meetups about Salesforce development and AI (recently), but don't get me wrong, is an excuse to talk to people and drink beer.

### ⚡ Fun facts 
* My daily driver laptop is powered by Ubuntu derivatives, but I don't think this is the year of the Linux Desktop ;-).
* Even leaving in Barcelona, I am not a Barça fan, I know I deserve the maximum punishment for that, but ...
* I still think that Larry Bird and MJ are better that Lebron and Curry.

### Love contributing
If you think I can fit in a OSS project that you love that can help others, please let me know here [mailto:esteve.graells@gmail.com](mailto:esteve.graells@gmail.com)
